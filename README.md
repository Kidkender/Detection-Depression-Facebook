# Detection-Depression-Facebook
This is a project that predicts the likelihood of depression through facebook statuses using machine learning algorithms.
Here we use a variety of algorithms to compare for the most optimal accuracy .
We use two data sources: 
1. Twitter's depressing text dataset.
2. Data set of active time of depressed patients and ordinary people.
  Use chain processing, characteristic extraction analysis to come up with the best dataset
Our interface is quite simple. You just need to paste the link of a personal page on any Facebook page.
The results give a series of status lines of that facebook page and there are accompanying comments of each line . And finally, the results predict the likelihood of depression.
